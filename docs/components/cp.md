# Canvas Panel

import { GitHubDiscussion } from "../../GitHubDiscussion.js";


When building a IIIF Presentation API viewer, it will be much easier to use Canvas Panel than [the img-service tag](./single-image-service). This is because you are dealing with canvases in manifests - you pass the canvas to Canvas Panel to render, rather than wrrying about its content. It might not even have an image service.


TODO: This page needs a discussion of Canvas Panel's types, from https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-canvas-panel/discussions/33#discussion-3509526

See the [quick start](../intro) to get started.
