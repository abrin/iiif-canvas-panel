# Installation for development and production

This page describes the various ways to reference/import the components. E.g., via CDN, locally, etc.
It gives examples of plain JS, TypeScript, and some use with frameworks.

It also shows what references you need depending on what you are planning on doing.

 - You might just want a reference to Vault.
 - Then a CP bundle that includes Vault and CP.
 - Then maybe other components.

This page needs to give the examples you need to get started, beyond the quickstart use of CDN references.

(An expansion of https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-canvas-panel/discussions/101 but covers all the components).
