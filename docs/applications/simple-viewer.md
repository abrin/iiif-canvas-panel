# Simple Viewer

This is a very minimal IIIF viewer that can load a manifest, display thumbnails, and load canvases in response to user navigation through the thumbnails.

_The code below shows how CP plus a few other UI components, combined with vault, can load manifests, render thumbnails, and show the canvases. The code is simple against a vault-normalised Presentation 3 representation._

_This viewer is then extended by [Content State Selector](./content-state-selector) and [Text-centric Viewer](./text-centric)._
