This viewer extends [Simple Viewer](./simple-viewer) to add support for:

* Text selection on the Canvas
* Text display alongside the Canvas

...building on the [text examples](../../docs/examples/handling-text).

It also demonstrates how Canvas Panel can be used to make any text in IIIF resources accessible to assistive technologies.
