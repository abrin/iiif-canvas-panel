# A Bookreader viewer, with facing pages

import { GitHubIssue } from "../../GitHubDiscussion.js";


This example builds on the minimal viewer by adding support for 2-up views - facing pages - and showing simple annotations.

_This viewer is then extended by [Content State Selector](./content-state-selector) and [Text-centric Viewer](./text-centric)._
