# Building a Simple Viewer

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import { GitHubDiscussion } from "../../GitHubDiscussion.js";
import source from '!!raw-loader!../../static/demos/simplest-viewer.html';

This is a very minimal IIIF viewer that can load a manifest, display thumbnails, and load canvases in response to user navigation through the thumbnails.

You can see it running at /demos/simplest-viewer.html <a href="/demos/simplest-viewer.html" target="_blank">Simplest Viewer</a>.


_The code below shows how CP plus a few other UI components, combined with vault, can load manifests, render thumbnails, and show the canvases. The code is simple against a vault-normalised Presentation 3 representation._

<CodeBlock
  language="html"
  title="Simple viewer"
  metastring="{30-32}"
  showLineNumbers>
    {source}
</CodeBlock>


<GitHubDiscussion ghid="20" />
