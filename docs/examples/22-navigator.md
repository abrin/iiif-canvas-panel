# Navigator

:::danger

This is currently unstable

:::

Canvas panel has an optional viewport navigator:

```html
<canvas-panel
   manifest-id="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b14658197"
   canvas-id="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b14658197/canvases/b14658197.jp2"
   enable-navigator="true"
/>
```

<canvas-panel
   manifest-id="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b14658197"
   canvas-id="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b14658197/canvases/b14658197.jp2"
   enable-navigator="true"
/>

The navigator mini-window will also show a miniature view of the annotations on the canvas.

This is an initial implementation and will be developed further.
